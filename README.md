Live Demo: https://smalhar32.github.io/project-5/
 
- **Topic Covered:** HTML, CSS
- **Description:** Enhance the "Contact Us" form created in Project Exercise 2 by applying CSS for better styling. Add hover effects to the submit button to improve user interaction, change the borders of input fields when they are focused, and refine the overall form layout with proper spacing and alignment. Use properties like `border-radius` for rounded corners, padding for inner spacing, and pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:focus` for interactivity.
- **Skills Covered:** Advanced form styling, pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:focus`), border-radius for rounded corners, and using padding to improve form aesthetics.
